# Convolutional neural network created using NumPy only

I created this project to ensure I know exactly how CNNs work by coding one from scratch by myself. Validation that the network works was documented in [this file](https://github.com/SewerynKras/CNN-only-NumPy/blob/master/test_mnist.ipynb)

## Dependencies

-NumPy\
\
([test_mnist.py](https://github.com/SewerynKras/CNN-only-NumPy/blob/master/test_mnist.ipynb) uses TensorFlow to download the dataset)
